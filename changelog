Vinyl 0.4
=========

Vinyl 0.4 is a big departure from previous versions, in that it introduces a
universe encoding as a means to generalize the space of keys from strings to
any arbitrary space. This means that you can have closed universes for your
records.

For details on how to use the new Vinyl, please see `tests/Intro.lhs` or view
Jon's talk at BayHac 2014, [Programming in
Vinyl](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2014-05-19-programming-in-vinyl-bayhac.html).
